# ``RVS_MaskButton``

A Special UIButton Variant That Allows "See-Through" Masking.

## Overview

## Dependencies

The button class, itself, has no dependencies, but the test harness depends on the [RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox module](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_Generic_Swift_Toolbox), and the [RVS_BasicGCDTimer module](https://github.com/RiftValleySoftware/RVS_BasicGCDTimer).
We use the "Let's Go Digital" font, from Wolf Lambert (WLM Fonts), in the test harness app.
